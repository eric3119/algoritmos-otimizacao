abstract = "The design of cellular manufacturing systems (CMS) involves many structural and operational issues. One of the important design steps is the formation of part families and machine cells. In this paper, a comprehensive mathematical model for the design of \{CMS\} based on tooling requirements of the parts and tooling available on the machines is proposed. The model incorporates dynamic cell configuration, alternative routings, lot splitting, sequence of operations, multiple units of identical machines, machine capacity, workload balancing among cells, operation cost, cost of subcontracting part processing, tool consumption cost, setup cost, cell size limits, and machine adjacency constraints. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the model and its potential benefits. "

	return home to where you began. Though seemingly modest, this exercise
	has inspired studies by mathematicians, chemists, and physicists.
	Teachers use it in the classroom. It has practical applications in
	genetics, telecommunications, and neuroscience. The authors of this
	book are the same pioneers who for nearly two decades have led the
	investigation into the traveling salesman problem. They hav derived
	solutions to almost eighty-six thousand cities, yet a general solution
	to the problem has yet to be discovered. Here they describe the method
	and computer code they used to solve a broad range of large-scale
	problems, and along the way they demonstrate the interplay of applied
	mathematics with increasingly powerful computing platforms. They
	also give the fascinating history of the problem--how it developed,

  abstract = {An approach for manufacturing cell formation with machine modification
	is presented. In cell formation it is often important in practice
	to be able to reassign parts to additional machine types in order
	to create better cell configurations. This involves extending the
	set of parts that certain individual machines can process. Such extensions
	may be cheaper than simply purchasing additional machines. Thus,
	there is the possibility of machine modification to reduce inter-cell
	travel. The cost of such modifications must be balanced by the consequent
	reduction in inter-cell travel cost. The extended machine cell formation
	problem to be described involves the specification of which individual
	machines should be modified to enable them to process additional
	part types, part-machine assignment, and the grouping of individual
	machines for cell formation. The objective is to minimize the sum
	of the machine modification costs and the inter-cell travel. We call
	this the sustainable cell formation problem (SCFP). As far as the
	authors are aware, there have not been any solution procedures for
	this important problem reported in the open literature. It is our
	purpose to fill this gap by presenting a mixed integer programming
	model of the SCFP. We also propose and analyze greedy and tabu search
	heuristics for the design of large-scale systems related to the SCFP.

	they are likely to be useful additions to the production engineer's

	is to minimize inter-cellular movements. Inspired by the rational
	behind the so called grouping genetic algorithm (GGA), this paper
	proposes a grouping version of differential evolution (GDE) algorithm
	and its hybridized version with a local search algorithm (HGDE) to
	solve benchmarked instances of cell formation problem posing as a
	grouping problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach,
	we borrow a set of 40 problem instances from literature and compare
	the performance of GGA and GDE. We also compare the performance of
	both algorithms when they are tailored with a local search algorithm.
	Our computations reveal that the proposed algorithm performs well
	on all test problems, exceeding or matching the best solution quality
	of the results presented in previous literature.},

  abstract = {Available research on the manufacturing cell formation problem shows

	solutions being easily trapped in local optima and bad solution efficiency.
	Yang and Wang [Yang, F.-C., Wang, Y.-P., 2007. Water flow-like algorithm
	for object grouping problems. Journal of the Chinese Institute of
	Industrial Engineers, 24 (6), 475–488] proposed the water flow-like
	algorithm (WFA) to overcome the shortcomings of single- and multiple-solution
	-agent-based algorithms. WFA has the features of multiple and dynamic
	numbers of solution agents, and its mimicking of the natural behavior
	of water flowing from higher to lower levels coincides exactly with
	the process of searching for optimal solutions. This paper therefore
	adopts the WFA logic and designs a heuristic algorithm for solving
	the cell formation problem. Computational results obtained from running
	a set of 37 test instances from the literature and newly created
	have shown that the proposed algorithm has performed better than
	other benchmarking approaches both in solution effectiveness and
	efficiency, especially in large-sized problems. The superiority of
	the proposed WFACF over other approaches from the literature should
	be attributed to the collaboration of the WFA logic, the proposed
	prior estimation of the cell size, and the insertion-move. The WFA
	is a novel heuristic approach that deserves more attention. More
	attempts on adopting the WFA logic to solve many other combinatorial
	optimization problems are highly recommended.},
